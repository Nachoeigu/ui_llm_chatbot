# UI Customized Chatbot

This project is basically a custom chatbot that you can customize for your specific use case. These are the base settings. Some use cases you might consider:

- Easily change models (between different enterprise or open source ones).
- Adding RAG so it uses you own data.
- Customize its behaviour with prompt engineering.
- Deeply modify the basic developed chain of the Chatbot for whatever you case you need.
- Integrate in a Langgraph enviroment so you can deploy autonomous AI agents.
- Add tools to the chatbot so it can interact with other services/apps.

Basically, whatever you have in your mind. It could be possible. :)
